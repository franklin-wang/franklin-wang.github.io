# bio
![football](/assets/img/illinois_football.jpeg)

Before moving to the United States, I lived in Sai Kung, a seaside district in Hong Kong. I'm an identical triplet: there are two genetic copies of me living in Wisconsin and Tennessee! Asides from astronomy, I enjoy skiing, country music, the Chicago Bears, Illini Athletics, and, since very recently, fishing.

My first couple of years in the U.S was spent in Champaign, Illinois: I obtained my bachelor's degree in Astronomy from the University of Illinois. At Illinois, I was a member of the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity, and worked as its philanthropy chair, recruitment chair, and chapter president. In addition to my social fraternity, I played wing on the Illinois Men's Rugby Football Club during my freshman and sophomore years, and volunteered with the Epsilon Eta environmental honors fraternity.

Since moving to College Station, I've started to become involved in [Astronomy on Tap](https://astronomyontap.org/locations/bcs-tx/).

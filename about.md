# bio
![football](/assets/img/illinois_football.jpeg)

Before moving to the United States, I grew up in Sai Kung (西貢), a seaside district in Hong Kong. I'm an identical triplet: there are two genetic copies of me living in Wisconsin and Tennessee! 

My first couple of years in the U.S was spent in Champaign, Illinois: I obtained my bachelor's degree in Astronomy (with a minor in Physics) from the University of Illinois. I was a member of the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity, and served as its philanthropy chair, recruitment chair, and chapter president. In addition to my social fraternity, I played wing on the Illinois Men's Rugby Club during my freshman and sophomore years, and volunteered with the Epsilon Eta environmental honors fraternity. 

Since moving to College Station, I've become more involved in astronomy-related outreach. I've spoken at our local [Astronomy on Tap](https://astronomyontap.org/locations/bcs-tx/), ...

Asides from astronomy, I enjoy skiing, skateboarding, country music, fishing, Illini Athletics, and, perhaps unfortunately, the Chicago Bears.

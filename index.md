<p style="text-align: center;"># howdy!</p>
I'm Franklin, a first-year Astronomy Ph.D. student at Texas A&M. I'm currently working with Professor [Jonelle Walsh](https://jonellewalsh.weebly.com/) on making stellar dynamical mass measurements of supermassive black holes. In broad strokes, I'm interested in black hole evolution: I want to see how estimates of black hole masses can provide insight into how they grow over cosmic time.

# howdy!

I'm Franklin, a first-year graduate student at Texas A&M's Department of Physics & Astronomy. I'm currently working with Professor [Jonelle Walsh](https://jonellewalsh.weebly.com/) on using stellar kinematics to estimate the masses of supermassive black holes.

I obtained my bachelor's degree in Astronomy from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I worked with Professor [Xin Liu](https://publish.illinois.edu/liu-group/) on intermediate-mass black holes.

I'm Franklin, a first-year Astronomy Ph.D. student at Texas A&M. I'm currently working with Professor [Jonelle Walsh](https://jonellewalsh.weebly.com/) on making stellar dynamical mass measurements of supermassive black holes. In broad strokes, I'm interested in black hole evolution: I want to see how estimates of black hole masses can provide insight into how they grow over cosmic time. You can read more about my research [here](https://franklin-wang.github.io/research.html).



I am also passionate about scientific communication and education. I will start working as an organizer for Astronomy on Tap BCS next spring. More information on my teaching and outreach activities can be found [here](https://franklin-wang.github.io/outreach.html).

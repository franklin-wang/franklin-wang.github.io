# howdy!

I'm Franklin, a first-year Ph.D. student at Texas A&M's Department of Physics & Astronomy. I'm currently working with Professor [Jonelle Walsh](https://jonellewalsh.weebly.com/) on using stellar kinematics to weigh supermassive black holes. I'm interested in black hole evolution, and how estimates of their masses can provide insight into how black holes grow over cosmic time.

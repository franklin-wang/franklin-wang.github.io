# howdy!

I'm Franklin, a first-year Ph.D. student at Texas A&M's Department of Physics & Astronomy. I'm interested in black hole evolution, and how estimates of their masses can provide insight into how black holes grow over cosmic time. Currently, I'm working with Professor [Jonelle Walsh](https://jonellewalsh.weebly.com/) on using stellar kinematics to weigh supermassive black holes. ![headshot alt >](/assets/img/headshot_300.png)

I'm Franklin, a third-year Astronomy Ph.D. student at Texas A&M. I'm currently working with Professor [Jonelle Walsh](https://jonellewalsh.weebly.com/) on making stellar dynamical mass measurements of supermassive black holes. In broad strokes, I'm interested in black hole-galaxy co-evolution: by weighing black holes, we can see how they grow with their galactic hosts over cosmic time.

I have several pages on this website: you can read more about [my research](https://franklin-wang.github.io/research.html), take a look at [my C.V](https://franklin-wang.github.io/vitae.html), see the [outreach projects](https://franklin-wang.github.io/outreach.html) I'm involved in, or just [get to know me](https://franklin-wang.github.io/about.html).

I'm currently advised by Professor Jonelle Walsh at Texas A&M. My research focuses on the supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies: using observational data, I am working to understand how these black holes evolve and grow.

A vast majority of (if not all!) galaxies are thought to harbor a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in a bulge at their centers. These SMBHs are believed to strongly influence the intrinsic nature of their hosts: observations have shown that the velocity dispersion, luminosity, and stellar mass of the galactic bulge are tightly correlated with the mass of the SMBH. However, dynamical mass measurements of SMBHs are difficult to make, limiting the sample that can be used to test these SMBH mass-bulge property correlations. Even more worryingly, the current sample (that consists of about 100 dynamical measurements) may be biased: measurements have only been made in galaxies that are smaller in radius relative to other galaxies at the same luminosity.

As such, I am working with the **Gemini Large and Long Program (LLP)** to address this bias. This program targets galaxies with sizes and luminosities that are not well represented in the current sample with integral field spectrographs (IFS or IFU) from Gemini NIFS and multiple instruments at the McDonald Observatory. In particular, I will be extracting stellar kinematics (that will be used in dynamical mass modelling) from data obtained by the **VIRUS-P** and **VIRUS-W** spectrographs on the 2.7m Harlan J. Smith telescope. These IFUs capture our target galaxies on larger scales, allowing us to better constrain their surrounding dark matter halos.

Intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) are thought to be the 'seeds' of supermassive black holes (like the ones I'm currently studying at Texas A&M!), but they have been extremely challenging to find. State-of-the-art astronomical surveys have finally started to discover some candidates, but we still lack an efficient and robust method to estimate their masses down to the lowest mass scales possible.

Intermediate Mass Black Holes (IMBHs) are thought to be the 'seeds' of supermassive black holes such as the one
							found at the center of our own Milky Way galaxy, but they have been extremely challenging to find. State-of-the-art
							astronomical surveys have finally started to discover some candidates, but we still lack an efficient and robust method
							to measure their masses down to the lowest mass scales possible. We have been developing a new black hole mass weighing
							method that may work even down to the scale of stellar mass black holes. This is very exciting, but we need to test it
							with a significant sample of known candidates of IMBHs.

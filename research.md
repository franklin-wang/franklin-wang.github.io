I'm currently advised by Professor Jonelle Walsh at Texas A&M. My research focuses on the supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies: using observational data, I am working to understand how these black holes evolve and grow.

A vast majority of (if not all!) galaxies are thought to harbor a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in a bulge at their centers. These SMBHs are believed to strongly influence the intrinsic nature of their hosts: observations have shown that the velocity dispersion, luminosity, and stellar mass of the galactic bulge are tightly correlated with the mass of the SMBH. However, dynamical mass measurements of SMBHs are difficult to make, limiting the sample that can be used to test these SMBH mass-bulge property correlations. Even more worryingly, the current sample (that consists of about 100 dynamical measurements) may be biased: measurements have only been made in galaxies that are smaller in radius relative to other galaxies at the same luminosity.

As such, I am working with the **Gemini Large and Long Program (LLP)** to address this bias. Specifically, I am extracting kinematics (that will be used for dynamical mass modelling) from galaxies that have sizes and luminosities that are not well represented in the current sample. I will be focusing on large scale integral field spectra from the **VIRUS-P** and **VIRUS-W** spectrographs on the **2.7m Harlan J. Smith telescope** at McDonald Observatory: these large scale spectra are effective in constraining the dark matter halos around our target galaxies.

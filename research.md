I'm currently advised by Professor Jonelle Walsh at Texas A&M. My research focuses on the supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies: using observational data, I am working to understand how these black holes evolve and grow.

A vast majority of (if not all!) galaxies are thought to harbor a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in a bulge at their centers. These SMBHs are believed to strongly influence the intrinsic nature of their hosts: observations have shown that the velocity dispersion, luminosity, and stellar mass of the galactic bulge are tightly correlated with the mass of the SMBH.

# outreach
### + Astronomy on Tap
[Astronomy on Tap](https://astronomyontap.org/locations/bcs-tx/) (AoT) is a (free!) monthly event featuring presentations on hot topics in astronomy. I am currently working as the main coordinator for the Bryan-College Station chapter of AoT.

### + Gateway to Graduate School
[Gateway to Graduate School](https://gradgateway.physics.tamu.edu/) is an event hosted by the Department of Physics & Astronomy at Texas A&M that aims to...historically excluded groups in academia.

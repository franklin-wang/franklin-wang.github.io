![aotpresent](/assets/img/aot_kbtx.png)
I was on KBTX talking about Astronomy on Tap, check it out <span style="color:blue">[here](https://www.kbtx.com/video/2024/10/21/science-beer-astronomers-hold-talk-downtown-bryan/)</span>!

[Astronomy on Tap](https://astronomyontap.org/locations/bcs-tx/) (AoT) is a (free!) monthly event featuring presentations on hot topics in astronomy. I am currently working as the main coordinator for the Bryan-College Station chapter of AoT. My responsibilities include recruiting monthly speakers, coordinating with our local venue (the Grand Stafford Theatre!), and occassionally giving a talk about black holes, planets, or aliens.

[Gateway to Graduate School](https://gradgateway.physics.tamu.edu/) is an event hosted by the Department of Physics & Astronomy at Texas A&M that aims to promote graduate school to historically excluded groups in academia. I will be the primary coordinator for the 2023-2024 Gateway to Graduate School session.
